# PyTorch Training Pipeline  

This project demonstrates how to build and train a simple neural network **from scratch** using the **Breast Cancer dataset** and PyTorchâ€™s autograd functionality.  

The goal is to provide a minimal working example for:  
- Preparing data for training  
- Implementing a neural network manually (without `nn.Module`)  
- Using autograd for backpropagation  
- Training with binary cross-entropy loss  
- Evaluating model performance  


##  Dataset 
It is a binary classification dataset with 30 features and a target variable (malignant or benign).  

## Results
During training, the loss decreases steadily as expected with Final model accuracy: 52.8%

## Future Improvements

Improve accuracy by adding multiple layers

Use train/validation split with evaluation metrics

Plot training curves (loss vs epochs, accuracy vs epochs)

Experiment with optimizers (torch.optim)
